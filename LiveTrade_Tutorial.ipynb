Each of these extremely complex tasks were long thought to be impossible by machines, until only recently being made possible through the massive advancements in deep reinforcement learning. \n",

While I made quite a bit of progress on that front, I realized that the tooling for this sort of project can be quite daunting to wrap your head around, and as such, it is very easy to get lost in the details.\n",

        "In between optimizing my previous project for distributed high-performance computing (HPC) systems; getting lost in endless pipelines of data and feature optimizations; and running my head in circles around efficient model set-up, tuning, training, and evaluation; I realized that there had to be a better way of doing things. After countless hours of researching existing projects, spending endless nights watching PyData conference talks, and having many back-and-forth conversations with the hundreds of members of the  RL trading Discord community, I realized there weren't any existing solutions that were all that good.\n",

        "There were many bits and pieces of great reinforcement learning trading systems spread across the inter-webs, but nothing solid and complete.

        "_This technique is based off Markov Decision Processes (MDP) dating back to the 1950s._\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent will first observe the environment, then build a model of the current state and the expected value of actions within that environment. Based on that model, the agent will then take the action it has deemed as having the highest expected value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the effects of the chosen action within the environment, the agent will be rewarded by an amount corresponding to the actual value of that action. The reinforcement learning agent can then, through the process of trial and error (i.e. learning through reinforcement), improve its underlying model and learn to take more rewarding actions over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you still need a bit of refreshment on the subject, there is a link to an article titled _Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning_ in the references for this article, which goes much more in-depth into the details. Let's move on.\n",

        "The following tutorial should provide enough examples to get you started with creating simple trading strategies using TensorTrade, although you will quickly see the framework is capable of handling much more complex configurations.\n",

If a pipeline has been added to a particular exchange, then observations will be passed through the `FeaturePipeline` before being output to the environment. For example, a feature pipeline could normalize all price values, make a time series stationary, add a moving average column, and remove an unnecessary column, all before the observation is returned to the agent.\n",
